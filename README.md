> Basic Functionality 
1. Coder will get -1 each time someone solves their level.
2. Solver will get +1 each time they solve a level.
3. Ten different DBs to store the level answers for 10 themes.
4. A solver recod in DB will have 10 level variables i.e. alevel, blevel, clevel, ..., jlevel with initial value 0, increment particular variable by 1 for the level solved of that theme.
5. Keep 10 theme levels in 10 different folders for ease and name it as level0 (just a start button and theme name) , level1, level2, ..., level5.
